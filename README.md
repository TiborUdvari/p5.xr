# p5.xr

## STATUS
This is at a pre-pre-alpha stage. Alpha release is currently projected for early summer. The WebXR API is very unstable right now and development is in a minor limbo while waiting for that work to solidify. AR functionality is currently stubbed out in master. For simple sketches, VR works relatively well.

## BUILDING
As stated above, this is currently not guaranteed to work. All of the manual examples work well on a Samsung Galaxy S7 in Chrome. Much more in the way of testing, stabilization, optimization, and features to come.

to build package:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

to build docs:
- `npm run docs`
