## What is it?

p5.xr is an add-on for [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a Javascript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. p5.xr adds the ability to __run p5 sketches in Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality__. It does this with the help of [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/). This enables anyone familiar with p5 to start experimenting with these technologies with little setup.


## Features

p5.xr sketches can be run with [p5's online editor.](https://editor.p5js.org/) All of the existing p5 functionality works, and in addition, p5.xr allows you to:
