There are many ways to help out! These include:

- Making example sketches that can be featured on this page
- Filing bugs on the Github repo
- Contributing code. No matter your level, help is always welcome. Check out the Contributing page for more info.
- Donating. I make this project in my spare time, donations help me make time to work on improving this library.
