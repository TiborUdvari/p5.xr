There are many ways to help out! These include:

- __Making example sketches__ that can be featured on this page
- __Filing bugs on the Github repo__
- __Contributing code__. No matter your level, help is always welcome. Check out the Contributing page for more info.
- __Donating__. I make this project in my spare time, donations help me make time to work on improving this library.

If you have interest in contributing code, these are the areas that need the most help right now.
